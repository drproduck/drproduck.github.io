Notes on UOT

- Sunday Complete cleaning the main proof by Sunday
  - Theorem 1: Basically done
  - Lemma 4 (Relationship between optimal objective and optimal solution): Can it be improved w.r.t $\tau$ and $\eta$? Empirically, as $\tau$ decreases  the optimal solution sum reduces too. Write this as Corollary 1
  - Clean up lemma 5, 6, 7 leading up to the main theorem. See if anything can be improved technically
- Wednesday: Finish Multi-marginal OT. Ask anh Nhat and Tung about what experiments to do.
